\chapter{Tool}

This chapter covers the implementation of the \verb!ggt! tool.
The tool provides a common  interface to the different methods.
%
For now, only support for parametric assumptions is finished.

You first have to create an input file the defines the assumption.
We use the following file for the Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption.

\begin{verbatim}
setting symmetric.          (* symmetric (non-leveled) k-linear map *)
arity 2.                    (* fixes the arity k to 2 *)
problem_type decisional.

input
  [ 1
  , Y
  , forall i in [0, l - 1]: X^i
  , forall j in [l + 1, 2*l]: X^j ] @ 1.

challenge Y*X^l @ 2.\end{verbatim}
%
The tool can be used to analyze the assumption as follows.
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./ggt.native dhe.thy
[...]
The assumption is valid.\end{verbatim}
